Linux server monitoring with shell script

In this directory, I have two shell scripts, for automatic daily backup on external HD (backup.sh)
and another, metrics.sh, which has the function of collecting various critical information from the server along with the backup log generated by the backup.sh script and forwarding it to an email.

For automate it, you have to put metrics.sh on the cron. 

Any contribution, question or opinion is very accepted.
